        <p>The calculated profile shift of a gear pair can be distributed in any way between a gears.
            There are however a few considerations to take into account. For example, a spur gear having 17 or fewer teeth is prone to undercutting at
            the base of the tooth; this can be mitigated if a positive profile shift is applied to the gear. Equally, there are other considerations
            such as gear strength and sliding velocity.</p>
        <p>There are some empirical equations that can be applied to improve the design:</p>
        <p>For reduced sliding velocity</p>

        <p>For equal root stress</p>
        <include from="Snippets.topic" element-id="profile-shift-distribution-equal-root-stress"/>
        <p>For equal contact pressure</p>
